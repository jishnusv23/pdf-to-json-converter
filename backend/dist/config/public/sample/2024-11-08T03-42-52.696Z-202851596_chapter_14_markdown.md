\subsection*{14.1 INTRODUCTION}


Devices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the
 basic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of
 transistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called
 valves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often
 called plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes - cathode,
 plate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes).
 In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and
 the controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying
 the voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the
 inter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their
 energy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices
 the electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one
 direction). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.
 These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate
 generally at high voltages ( 100 V ) and have limited life and low reliability.
 The seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor
 electronics goes back to 1930's when it was realised that some solid
state semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling
 the number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.
 Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change
 the number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply


and flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the
 solid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons
 were obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an
 evacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space
 is required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume
 low power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.
 Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer
 monitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced
 by Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state
 electronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices
 was formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead
 sulphide, PbS ) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as
 detector of radio waves.


In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of
 semiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like
 junction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a
 3 -electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also
 be described.

 Semiconductors}</sectiontitle>


On the basis of conductivity

On the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity \((\sigma)\) or resistivity
 ( \(\rho=1 / \sigma\) ), the solids are broadly classified as:

(i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity).

\(\rho \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-8} \Omega \mathrm{~m}\)

\(\sigma \sim 10^{2}-10^{8} \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}\)

(ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate
 to metals and insulators.

\(\rho \sim 10^{-5}-10^{6} \Omega \mathrm{~m}\)

\(\sigma \sim 10^{5}-10^{-6} \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}\)

(iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity).

\(\rho \sim 10^{11}-10^{19} \Omega \mathrm{~m}\)

\(\sigma \sim 10^{-11}-10^{-19} \mathrm{~S} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}\)

The values of \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) given above are indicative of magnitude and
 could well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity
 are not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and
 semiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which
 will become clear as we go along in this chapter.


Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which
 could be:

(i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge

(ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:

- Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.

- Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.

- Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.


Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on
 elemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic
 semiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using

organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been
 developed signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer
electronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict
 ourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly
 elemental semiconductors Si and Ge . The general concepts introduced
 here for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply
 to most of the compound semiconductors as well.


\section*{On the basis of energy bands}


According to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of
 any of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when
 the atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So
 the outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very
 close or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion
 in a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.


Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two
 electrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because
 of this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different
 energy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called
 energy bands. The energy band which includes the energy levels of the
 valence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the
 valence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all
 the valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in
 the conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the
 valence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into
 the conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when
 it overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is
 the case with metallic conductors.


If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence
 band, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons
 are available in the conduction band. This makes the material an
 insulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain
 external energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the
 valence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.
 At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band
 where other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the
 possibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as
 due to vacancies in the valence band.


Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing
 \(N\) atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit \((n=3)\), while for Ge
 it is the fourth orbit ( \(n=4\) ). The number of electrons in the outermost
 orbit is 4 ( \(2 s\) and \(2 p\) electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons
 in the crystal is \(4 N\). The maximum possible number of electrons in the
 outer orbit is 8 ( \(2 s+6 p\) electrons). So, for the \(4 N\) valence electrons there
 are \(8 N\) available energy states. These \(8 N\) discrete energy levels can either
 form a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands
 depending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box
 on Band Theory of Solids).


At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge ,
 the energy band of these \(8 N\) states is split apart into two which are
 separated by an energy gap \(E_{g}\) (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is
 completely occupied by the \(4 N\) valence electrons at temperature of absolute
 zero is the valence band. The other band consisting of \(4 N\) energy states,
 called the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.

FIGURE <figurenumber>14.1 </figurenumber>The energy band positions in a
 semiconductor at 0 K . The upper band, called the
 conduction band, consists of infinitely large number
 of closely spaced energy states. The lower band,
 called the valence band, consists of closely spaced
 completely filled energy states.
</figure>

The lowest energy level in the
 conduction band is shown as \(E_{C}\) and
 highest energy level in the valence band
 is shown as \(E_{V}\). Above \(E_{C}\) and below \(E_{V}\)
 there are a large number of closely spaced
 energy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.


The gap between the top of the valence
 band and bottom of the conduction band
 is called the energy band gap (Energy gap
 \(E_{g}\) ). It may be large, small, or zero,
 depending upon the material. These
 different situations, are depicted in Fig.
 14.2 and discussed below:


Case I: This refers to a situation, as
 shown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a
 metal either when the conduction band
 is partially filled and the balanced band
 is partially empty or when the conduction
 and valance bands overlap. When there
 is overlap electrons from valence band can
 easily move into the conduction band.
 This situation makes a large number of
 electrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is
 partially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level
 making conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials
 is low or the conductivity is high.

Case II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap \(E_{g}\) exists
 \(\left(E_{g}>3 \mathrm{eV}\right)\). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore
 no electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large
 that electrons cannot be excited from the valence band to the conduction
 band by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.

Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small
 band gap ( \(E_{g}<3 \mathrm{eV}\) ) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room
 temperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough
 energy to cross the energy gap and enter the conduction band. These
 electrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band.
 Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the
 insulators.


In this section we have made a broad classification of metals,
 conductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will
 learn the conduction process in semiconductors.
